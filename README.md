## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Doing this card was fun because I wanna try to use only flexbox because it is a part of CSS I want to understand better, the color over the background was interesting to make, although it was not the same I think it was a good solution

This was the solution I implemented for the color over the background

```css
.card_header_pictures {
  border-radius: 15px 15px 0px 0px;
  background-color: hsl(277, 100%, 67%);
  opacity: 0.5;
}

.card_header_picture {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border-radius: 15px 15px 0px 0px;
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```
